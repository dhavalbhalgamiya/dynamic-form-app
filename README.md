# Dynamic Form App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and enhanced with Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Dynamic Form App, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. node js lts version.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhavalbhalgamiya/dynamic-form-app.git

### Available Scripts

Navigate to the project directory:
###  `cd dynamic-form-app`

Install the dependencies:

### `npm install`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.


#Project Structure
- src/formData.json: Contains the form structure and fields in a JSON format, which is used to dynamically generate the form.

- src/components: This folder contains the main components:

 - DynamicForm: This component is responsible for managing the dynamic form creation based on the JSON structure from formData.json.
 -  RenderFields: This component handles rendering the individual form inputs (such as text fields, dropdowns, etc.) passed by DynamicForm or from formData.json.
 -  Sidebar and Navbar: These components are used for layout and navigation purposes.
src/templates/Home.js: All the components are imported and rendered inside this template. The dynamic form and its associated data are managed here.

 -  App.js: The Home template and formData.json are imported into App.js to initialize the main application structure and logic.
